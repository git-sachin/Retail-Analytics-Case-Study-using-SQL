### **Retail Analytics Case Study Using SQL**

This project is a comprehensive case study in retail analytics, focusing on extracting actionable insights from retail transaction data using SQL. The primary objective was to support business decision-making by analyzing customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. By leveraging structured query language (SQL), the analysis provided valuable intelligence for marketing optimization, inventory management, and customer relationship strategies.

### **Project Goals**

The case study aimed to:

* Understand consumer purchasing behavior and segment customers based on loyalty, frequency, and monetary value.
* Identify top-performing and underperforming products across different categories and time periods.
* Analyze sales trends and seasonality to support demand forecasting and promotional planning.
* Clean and transform raw retail data to ensure high-quality and reliable analysis outputs.

### **Key Areas of Analysis**

#### üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Customer Segmentation**

* Used SQL queries to group customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values.
* Distinguished between high-value loyal customers, new customers, and churned customers.
* Helped define personalized marketing strategies and loyalty programs.

#### üì¶ **Product Performance Analysis**

* Evaluated product-level metrics such as total sales, quantity sold, average selling price, and revenue contribution.
* Identified fast-moving (high-volume) and high-margin products, as well as products with declining sales.
* Provided insights to optimize product assortment and discontinuation decisions.

#### üìà **Sales Trend Analysis**

* Analyzed monthly and quarterly sales data to uncover seasonal patterns and growth trajectories.
* Measured performance across different regions, customer demographics, and product categories.
* Supported business planning by highlighting peak seasons and slow periods.

#### üßπ **Data Cleaning & Transformation**

* Removed duplicates, standardized formats, and dealt with missing or inconsistent values.
* Joined multiple datasets (customers, orders, products, order details) using SQL joins to form a unified view.
* Created derived fields (e.g., total order value, price per unit) for deeper analysis.

### **Tools & Technologies**

* **SQL**: Core tool for querying, cleaning, joining, and analyzing datasets.
* **Datasets Used**:

  * `Customers`: customer\_id, name, location
  * `Products`: product\_id, name, category, price
  * `Orders`: order\_id, order\_date, customer\_id, total\_amount
  * `OrderDetails`: order\_id, product\_id, quantity, price\_per\_unit
* **Platform**: Simulated SQL environment (Coding Ninjas / local SQL database)

---

### **Business Impact & Insights**

* **Inventory Optimization**: Identified which products to restock, reduce, or discontinue based on demand trends.
* **Targeted Marketing**: Enabled personalized outreach based on customer behavior and purchase history.
* **Operational Efficiency**: Informed stock planning, customer retention strategies, and promotional timing with data-backed insights.
* **Sales Uplift**: Suggested data-driven actions that could lead to improved conversion rates and increased average order value.
